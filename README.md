# OpenAPI Generator Example with TypeScript

This repo demonstrates how to use OpenAPI-Generator with TypeScript. I use it as the example in my blog post at
https://stefanwille.com/blog.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn codegen`

Generated TypeScript client code from the OpenAPI API specification file.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
